The students found it easy to learn by following the Brackeys 2D tutorial series.
And, I teach students how to create and play a video game using code adapted from NES-style games.

We will now try to build some mini-games, designed for 2 to 16 players, using the assets provided by Brackeys:
[https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle](https://brackeysgames.itch.io/brackeys-platformer-bundle)

The game can receive integer inputs from:

* `2026_01_18_gdp_nes_udp_multiplayer`
* Custom code with device listeners

A default input system is also included, allowing the game to read NES controls directly from a device input if no external source is used.
